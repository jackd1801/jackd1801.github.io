<p>I’m spending the week in the northern city of Musanze. It’s for work, and most of my day is spent sitting in a small conference room at a hotel with my colleagues. Living here I’ve chosen to stay in modest accommodation, costing around £8 per night. It’s still in the main city area but closer to the locals than I’m used to in Kigali.</p>
<p>Walking down the streets here I can’t help but feel intense guilt and sadness about the state of poverty. On my way back to the conference room from a café I saw a disabled person dragging themselves along the street. They had guards on their legs to stop them scraping and flip flops on their hands to protect from the ground. I walked past knowing that if I looked back I would be asked for money, so I didn’t. It’s the worst I’ve felt about not giving money since arriving here.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges living in a country as poor as Rwanda is knowing that a small amount of my money could make a big difference to a great many of the people living here. If I wiped out my net worth I could probably substantially improve the lives of around 40-50 people. Perhaps a multiple of that if thinking on a shorter time frame. If I cut down my recreational spending one or two more a month. But this doesn’t attack the root of the problem, the poverty of the society overall.</p>
<p>This week I’ve been struggling because I’ve been exposed to so much more visible poverty than I’m used to. I would assume it’s mostly borne of ignorance, but my experience of Kigali has been a relatively poor but well-run city, where despite its limited wealth, the standard of living is comparatively high and visible poverty low.</p>
<p>As an economist with a strong leaning towards markets and trade being good things, the only sustainable way out of this is Rwanda’s economy developing substantially. Unfortunately, that will take a long-time to impact the lives of the people I see here each day living in horrible poverty.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what the answer to all this is. Giving money to these countries and increasing the standard of living of those here is an option. I believe there is an overwhelming moral imperative for the richer countries of the world to send much more money to the world’s poorest. However, while this alleviates some suffering short-term it’s unclear if it moves the needle in the long-term towards developing a real economy that can provide for people on its own.</p>
<p>I’ve never felt so insignificant in my ability to impact the world and its problems as I have now. I had generally been able to maintain some disconnect between my actions and my existence in the world and that of those living in such extreme poverty. While I felt awful for them and appreciated that I enjoyed a standard of living far higher, I didn’t feel a strong amount of personal responsibility to do something about it.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years I’d settled on my most important goal in life as becoming a father. Even though I’m single and not really in a location where I can meet a long-term partner, it’s felt like the thing I should be spending my time on once I’ve finished my contract. In fact, I’ve been toying with leaving early due to the lack of action I’m able to take on it while living in such a transcient place. My headcanon had been that I’d finish my contract, move to Canada or the US, get married, have kids, and find a well-paid, boring job to support them.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m not sure I could mentally cope with that trade-off. Knowing that I could be doing more to help those less fortunate than me, in whatever way I can. Earning to give is an option but feels insignificant compared to the scale of the problem. I feel small thinking about how I could even begin to tackle these challenges, but a sense of duty to try.</p>
