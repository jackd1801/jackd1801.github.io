<p>I&rsquo;ve been increasingly using ChatGPT as part of my role and in my personal life for various tasks. This was originally mostly limited to niche coding tasks that I needed help with, or reformatting code that I&rsquo;d already done. It&rsquo;s saved me a fair amount of time and lets me do more work in a day than I otherwise would have.</p>
<p>However, over time, I&rsquo;ve started using it for daily tasks that I could realistically do on my own in not much longer than it takes to prompt + edit the outputs. And I think that&rsquo;s dangerous for my ability to do my job. Each time I pass the work on I&rsquo;m becoming less familiar with how to do it myself and the learning that comes with doing tasks repetitively. While this is fine for mundane tasks, the more I outsource higher-level tasks, the more I outsource the actual learning and thinking that comes along with it.</p>
<p>Often when you speak to managers that have risen above having to do any of the technical analysis themselves, they&rsquo;ll tell you that they wouldn&rsquo;t know how to start doing some of the things they&rsquo;re asking you to do. Technical skills are the same as muscles, and if you don&rsquo;t exercise them they&rsquo;ll start to atrophy. Going from being a manager back down to technical roles is really hard, especially in fields such as data science where technologies and best practice change drastically from year to year.</p>
<p>The ChatGPT workflow is analogous to becoming a mini manager, delegating the technical work to a lower-level employee. As I&rsquo;m outsourcing more and more tasks, I feel myself being more and more managerial in workflow. And I can feel my skills getting worse as I do it. When I start a coding project I&rsquo;ve started to rely on ChatGPT setting up the barebones code which I can start to edit through further prompts. I&rsquo;m not doing it myself and I&rsquo;m not learning through repetition how to code the analysis I want to do, or understanding exactly how the code works to a high-level.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is that by outsourcing the thinking on some of the technical work, I&rsquo;m able to spend more brain power thinking about the bigger picture. What analysis is most helpful in this situation? What question am I trying to answer? What does this tell me now that I&rsquo;ve got a chart to look at? And freeing up time and headspace to think about these things is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>The challenge is finding balance for these two competing forces. Especially when the technology is in a phase that allows it to hallucinate and create wrong outputs.</p>
<p>ChatGPT, and tools like it, are productivity enhancing for roles like mine. I can get more done in the same amount of time as I used to because I&rsquo;m able to outsource various technical tasks that ChatGPT generally excels at. But it comes with a disclaimer that I need to use some of the extra time I get back to fully understand and learn from the outputs. I&rsquo;m an intermediate level coder so I can quality assure a lot with a quick glance, but sometimes it&rsquo;ll do something more advanced that works and I&rsquo;ll just run with it. Not taking the time to learn how the code fully works is actively detrimental to my own abilities and means that I will become even more dependent on ChatGPT to do the work for me as time goes on.</p>
<p>I can see this happening at a macro-scale very quickly, and indeed some of my colleagues are increasingly using ChatGPT for both coding and writing tasks. It&rsquo;s especially harmful for writing where the person prompting is not a native speaker of the output language. When you can&rsquo;t properly quality assure the work it&rsquo;s going to come back and bite you. Something will go wrong and it&rsquo;s likely your job that&rsquo;ll be on the line.</p>
<p>These tools are genuinely miraculous, and I love that it&rsquo;s been created. But we need to make sure that we use them to assist our own thinking and enhance our learning. By enabling us to do higher-level thinking and not get so stuck on the lower level tasks it&rsquo;s generally more productive overall. But by becoming too reliant on it we may completely outsource the thinking, learning, and new ideas that come with doing even the most mundane tasks.</p>
