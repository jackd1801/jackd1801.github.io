<p>This past week I’ve been feeling a bit lost about what to do. Work isn&rsquo;t taking enough of my time or mental energy to keep me stimulated, and I’ve not found any side projects that pique my interest. I think part of this has to do with not having any concrete goals right now – I have some longer-term ones in the back of my head, like where I want to go after this job and a broader scope of how I want the next 5 years to go, but nothing for the next 6 months – 1 year. So, I thought I would write some down.</p>
<p>Writing down some goals is almost always useful for me, even if I don’t necessarily achieve them or if they change somewhat along the way. It gives me something to aim for and point myself at when I get into these periods where I’m not quite so sure what I’m doing.</p>
<p>I’m going to break them down into a few different categories – and I’ll leave off some of the more specific work-based ones for organisational privacy. My goals will roughly follow the SMART (Specific Measure Achievable Relevant Time-Bound) framework – something I picked up in the civil service. I’ll do an assessment against this around Christmas time so will say these are to be achieved within the next 5 months.</p>
