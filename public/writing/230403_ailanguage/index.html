<p>One of the largest and most immediate impacts of GPT-4 and other emerging AI technology, like Whisper, Midjourney, and text-to-speech generation, is going to be on language.</p>
<p>There are three key areas where I think it’ll be applied in the near future, which are learning languages, media translation, and creation of a real life babel fish.  I finish up with some thoughts on what it might mean for work.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Language</strong></p>
<p>AI technology has the potential to transform language learning by providing an always-available personal tutor for almost any language we have data on.</p>
<p>These tutors will be cheaper, more tailored, and available at any time compared to existing modes of learning. One of my biggest issues with Duolingo has been the lack of interaction you have with the app. While they’ve attempted to solve these issues it really doesn’t come close to being able to converse with someone in that language and get real-time feedback on how you’re doing. Furthermore, the ability to tailor the way you learn the language to best fit your learning style will almost certainly make it easier for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>The impact this will have on the languages spoken in the world is unclear to me. On the one hand it makes learning English (and other large languages) significantly easier, and these languages have the biggest databases of knowledge to pull from which would likely make the models (tutors) better. But, it also means that learning old languages, potentially even lost ones if there’s a large enough training data set, can also be done in a way that has never been possible. While Duolingo is constrained by the people today who can make a sufficiently large training course for each language, GPT-4 and similar large language models will only be limited by whether or not there is a sufficient base of material for them to work with in existence. And while covered in the next section more clearly, being able to consume media in any language you want could further enhance the ability to learn a new language quickly, or entrench existing languages by only watching/reading in your native tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Media Translation</strong></p>
<p>High quality AI transcription and translation technology is set to revolutionize the way we consume media. This technology has the potential to eliminate language barriers and make media more accessible to people across the world, while also enabling the creation of entirely new forms of content.</p>
<p>The cost of transcription and translation are going to be near 0 compared to today. One of the more immediate examples I can think of where this technology might take-off is in international media dubbing. It will be possible to do near seamless AI transformations of existing media assets, like movies and TV shows, into any language. You can train a model on an actor’s voice, the language you want to do the dub into, and then use image generation software to change the onscreen face movements to match the new dub. It will be possible to consume any media asset in any language for very low cost. This could result in a boom of native language media as you can create content in your mother tongue and easily convert it to larger markets. It’ll also make existing content more accessible to bigger audiences as smaller markets which traditionally couldn’t support the cost of dubbing are now able to.</p>
<p>At a lower level, transcription and translation of news, videos, and all other media, will be automated by these technologies. It’ll be possible for me to watch a speech by a politician in almost any language and have it near instantaneously subtitled or dubbed in English. This will be true for YouTube videos, blog posts, podcasts, books, etc.</p>
<p>The long-term future of this, of course, is that movies as we understand them today are completely transformed. People may start to sell their likeness/voices to be used in AI generated movies. One of the viral videos in the past 2 weeks has been Harry Potter by Balenciaga, which demonstrates more clearly how this might all come together, with existing IP being imagined in completely new ways, and could result in a golden age of media creation.</p>

<p><strong>The real life babel fish</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, perhaps the most exciting potential of AI in language-related fields is the development of real-time translation technology. We are not far away from having a real life babel fish, a fictional device (well fish) from Douglas Adams’ series The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which once put into the users ear allows them to understand any spoken language in the universe. As touched on in the previous point about media translation – it will be possible to near instantaneously transcribe, translate and dub media in any language we want. Going beyond that we will be able to have conversations with people in real life or online with near instant translation.</p>
<p>This will probably come first to Microsoft Teams given their agreement with OpenAI, with participants being able to choose the language they want the output of the meeting to be in. For example, I could have a meeting with native Japanese, Chinese, and French speakers, set my output and input languages as English, and have all of their words translated to English for me as they speak, and vice versa. Similar to the media example, we can train AIs on our own voice so that they will still hear ‘us’ but just in their own language. This will probably first come as some form of subtitles before making the jump to being completely over voice, especially since Teams already has a functional live transcription service.</p>
<p>Moving forward it will be possible to have in real life real time translation, probably through an app and wireless earphones. And an exciting component of how all this technology will work is the hardware that could be developed to enable it. There’s probably a future where we have brain chips that alter our vision so that we see a real time lip-sync of the person we’re conversing with that will make it appear as though we really are speaking the same language.</p>
<p>The creation of such technologies will enable cross-country working in a way that has never been possible before. Businesses will be able to expand and explore new markets, as language will no longer be a major barrier to entry. For example, businesses will be able to communicate more effectively with customers and clients in different countries, negotiate contracts with foreign suppliers, and collaborate with international teams on projects.</p>
<p><strong>What it could mean for work</strong></p>
<p>The impact of AI on language-related fields has significant implications for the job market and how we approach language learning, media translation, and communication. While some jobs may be replaced by automation, such as transcription and translation, this technology has the potential to better utilise human expertise and allow us to focus on more meaningful tasks. Similar to the automation of data entry, AI-powered language and media tools enable us to move up the value chain of activities and concentrate on analysis and creating compelling content. This will lead to new opportunities for professionals in language-related fields to focus on higher-level tasks such as content creation, cultural understanding, and strategy, rather than just the mechanics of translation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see where it goes and think this could be some of the areas where we see the fastest adoption and outputs of AI technologies.</p>
