<p>Hello world. It has been a long time (over a year) since I&rsquo;ve managed to follow through and write a blog post. A lot has happened in that time and as of yesterday I have finally felt somewhat on top of my life.</p>
<p>To commemarate such a joyous event I&rsquo;m going to write a blog post every day this week with the aspiration of actually getting this going with a large collection of writing.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons for this, as covered in a previous post [230830_WritingMore.md] but additionally I have been AI-pilled that writing and publishing things on the internet is probably the most impactful way of having your ideas and therefore view of the world incorporated into the future. I&rsquo;ve found myself increasing using AI for more and more tasks, I think it&rsquo;s made me slightly dumber. I&rsquo;ve fallen victim to the outsourcing that I had previously written about. To counter this I want to expand on many of the things that I think AI will actually find it hard to replace, and thus become more important as we move into a world where it might replace a lot of the knowledge work that myself, and others like me, currently spend our time on.</p>
<p>Namely I want to focus on social dynamics, friend making and friends in general, and some level of community building. This will include some how-to&rsquo;s, some general rules and principles that govern social settings, and generally what I&rsquo;ve learned over the years as I&rsquo;ve transitioned from extremely awkward nerd to slightly awkward nerd.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also try to upload a few pieces of general commentary, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of travelling over the past two years which has given me a lot of perspective about some of the quirks of the world, mostly in relation to Africa.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
