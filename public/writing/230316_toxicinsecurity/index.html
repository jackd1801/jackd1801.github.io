<p>Insecurity and low self-esteem have been persistent mental health challenges for me throughout my life. These issues began around the age of 9, when I started comparing myself to others more frequently. One of the more toxic consequences of these issues has been its impact in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>My thought pattern typically goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not unique or special.</li>
<li>I am easily replaceable.</li>
<li>If we break up, I give my partner a chance to find someone who is unique/special/irreplaceable.</li>
<li>By breaking up, I am doing them a favour and giving them the opportunity to find a better partner.</li>
<li>I detach from the relationship and instigate a breakup.</li>
</ol>
<p>A song thats stuck with me on this, and has probably negatively impacted my thought process, is &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; by Lil Dicky. It&rsquo;s about an ex-boyfriend who regrets his past decisions and inability to care for a girl, focusing on his perceived replaceability and lack of contribution to the relationship. One particular line, &ldquo;You could find another me tomorrow, and that&rsquo;s the hardest pill to swallow,&rdquo; almost perfectly describes how I’ve felt when I’ve been in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>This mindset robs my partner of their ability to feel sad about the breakup. After all, why should they be sad? I’m doing them a favour by letting them find happiness with someone else. It also diminishes my role in the relationship because I don’t see myself as someone that provides them with any joy or meaning.</p>
<p>Ironically, if I genuinely believe in my replaceability, I should have a strong incentive not to break up. Leaving a relationship would put me in a shitty position as I would need to find someone else who thinks I’m worth their time. This should motivate me to work on the relationship I already have, but it doesn’t.</p>
<p>This insecurity has led me to not fully invest in my relationships. I avoid discussing problems because I feel it would be easier for my partner to find someone else, causing me to emotionally withdraw. And it&rsquo;s led me to be surprised at the depth of pain and confusion experienced by my ex-partners, who feel blindsided by the breakup.</p>
<p>My insecurity has justified unhealthy behaviour in relationships based on my incorrect self-image and misconception of my importance to others. I&rsquo;m actively working on this and have made a decent amount of progress compared to even 6 months ago, and is part of a wider acceptance that I own all of my actions regardless of intent.</p>
