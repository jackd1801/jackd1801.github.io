I've styled this post as a brief FAQ to cover the main differences between the mainstream and the faststream options for joining the UK Civil Service as an economist. Please see my previous post for why I think this is an opportunity you should consider and more general information about the job. 

**Application Process**

Both application processes require candidates to do a numerical and situational assessment test. This is done online and is multiple choice. 

**Contracts**

Faststream economists are brought in at their own special grade for the civil service. This generally means that they are paid less than equivalent mainstream economists. 


**Rotations**

The faststream places candidates into a 'home' department. They then go on managed rotations on a yearly basis, working in different teams or different departments depending on which department is your 'home'. Cabinet Office often have their employees rotate internally only, whereas other departments, such as the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Defence operate as a trio, allowing any employee with one of these as a home department to rotate to the others. These pairings are not made available online so when giving preference always put the department you want to work for the most at the top, though I'm skeptical how much these are used for job matching. 

Mainstream candidates still have options
