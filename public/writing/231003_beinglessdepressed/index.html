<p>Disclaimer: Somewhat woo post</p>
<p>In the past 2 years or so I&rsquo;ve been on a pretty strong upward trajectory in terms of my ambient mood. For some background I would say I&rsquo;d had on and off depression from about the time I was 16 (2012) to 25 (2021) with a huge variety of peaks and troughs, and the lowest points coming in 2014-17 when I was doing my undergrad. It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly where it started but I feel the biggest origin point was a combination of extremely low self-esteem and a lack of a strong social support network.</p>
<p>Support network issues were actually somewhat my own and I underestimated how much I could lean on people without causing them to buckle.</p>
<p>Self-esteem will always be there in parts because it&rsquo;s easy to criticise yourself, and it&rsquo;s been a long journey to get it under control, including surgery and therapy.</p>
<p>Increasingly believe that you can do a lot of the work yourself and pysop yourself into becoming less depressed. Some of the steps are the cliche but correct fix your sleep, do regular exercise, eat healthy foods, and get some sunlight. The harder but also correct cliche of making a good friend group and finding your passions are also within your control but depending on circumstances can be harder to solve.</p>
<p>One of the things that helped the most was making more friends. It&rsquo;s hard to force yourself to do this, and can be almost impossible when you&rsquo;re in a fully depressed state. Not wrongly, lots of people don&rsquo;t really want to be friends with someone that&rsquo;s clearly depressed. It helps to go to things you used to enjoy, I found my friends through doing ultimate frisbee and bouldering. Two sports that I&rsquo;d participated in previously and communities that reliably have people I find it easy to connect with.</p>
