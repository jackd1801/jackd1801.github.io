<p>I want to write more. I want to write a lot more.</p>
<p>I want to take more notes, I want to journal more frequently, and I want to blog more frequently too.</p>
<p>I recently re-read Paul Grahams Essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">Writing, Briefly</a> and it affirmed what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about recently with respect to writing. Writing, and especially writing frequently, is so important for increasing your ability to learn and grow, your ability to communicate with the world, and a whole host of other positive outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Skill</strong></p>
<p><em>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” - Samuel Beckett</em></p>
<p>Writing, as a skill, is something I&rsquo;ve undervalued for most of my life. Having gone into technical roles post-university I&rsquo;ve never had to write too much and what I have written didn&rsquo;t need to be done particularly well. But as I move further up the career ladder, being able to write and argue my ideas convincingly has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>As Paul says in his essay, writing forces you to distil your thoughts and your core arguments into the purest form. If you aren&rsquo;t clear and precise with your language it will be difficult for others to get your message. If you haven&rsquo;t tightened up your arguments it won&rsquo;t be convincing to those who read them.</p>
<p>By writing more I hope to develop my feel and taste for writing. I want to develop my own style, and to do so in a way that resonates with other people. I&rsquo;ve noticed in other domains that the more I practice, the better able I am to identify my strengths and weaknesses and then improve upon them. For instance, I can often just look at the various new boulder problems in the climbing gym and identify exactly which ones I will be able to do first time vs those I&rsquo;m unlikely to be able to do at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe not the only way, but certainly one of the more effective ways for me to improve is to just keep getting the reps in.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve become more and more convinced that having a large body of notes is crucial for understanding and organising your own life. Even though I&rsquo;ve done it sporadically for the past 2 years, with only about 20-25 entries in total, my journal provides so much insight into how I felt at different points in my life and helps me understand where I am now.</p>
<p>My best friend started taking notes of almost everything he does about 6 years ago - including meetings he&rsquo;s had, sporting activities, and the food he&rsquo;s eaten. Now he has a complete searchable database of basically every piece of information relating to his life for that time. In a work context the value is obvious as he&rsquo;s able to go back and explore topics or actions discussed months after the fact in a way that&rsquo;s more thorough and detailed than anyone could on memory alone. He can also go back through and understand how different activities or events impacted on his mood, giving him a better understanding of himself and how changing variables in his life affect him more generally. It&rsquo;s basically a superpower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not been able to keep up with that same level of detail or consistency, but increasing the frequency of journaling is a good base to build from going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>
<p>Writing helps de-clutter my brain. On some days it feels as though I&rsquo;m having 20 thoughts at once and they&rsquo;re all flying around competing for my attention. Writing my thoughts down, and working through the more urgent ones, is so effective at removing the clutter and letting me focus on the things that are important. Focus is my most valuable resource for doing congnitive work. If I don&rsquo;t have the mental clarity to focus, I struggle to get through even the simplest tasks I might have for that day.</p>
<p><strong>Originality</strong></p>
<p><em>Good writers borrow, great writers steal - T.S. Eliot</em></p>
<p>One of the key things I&rsquo;ve taken from <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv">Visa&rsquo;s</a> writing is that being original is overrated/impossible. Everything is a remix of something someone&rsquo;s already done. While the ideas covered in this post have been touched on by others, I&rsquo;m still able to contribute something new by taking them and spinning it together in my own way. And the more I write the better able I&rsquo;ll be to imbue my own voice and ideas into the ones that have come before.</p>
<p>This is just the start of that journey.</p>
