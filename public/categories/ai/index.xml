      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been increasingly using ChatGPT as part of my role and in my personal life for various tasks. This was originally mostly limited to niche coding tasks that I needed help with, or reformatting code that I&amp;rsquo;d already done. It&amp;rsquo;s saved me a fair amount of time and lets me do more work in a day than I otherwise would have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, over time, I&amp;rsquo;ve started using it for daily tasks that I could realistically do on my own in not much longer than it takes to prompt + edit the outputs. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s dangerous for my ability to do my job. Each time I pass the work on I&amp;rsquo;m becoming less familiar with how to do it myself and the learning that comes with doing tasks repetitively. While this is fine for mundane tasks, the more I outsource higher-level tasks, the more I outsource the actual learning and thinking that comes along with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the largest and most immediate impacts of GPT-4 and other emerging AI technology, like Whisper, Midjourney, and text-to-speech generation, is going to be on language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three key areas where I think it’ll be applied in the near future, which are learning languages, media translation, and creation of a real life babel fish.  I finish up with some thoughts on what it might mean for work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
