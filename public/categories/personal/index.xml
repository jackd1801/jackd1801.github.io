      <title>Goals [July - December 2023]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week I’ve been feeling a bit lost about what to do. Work isn&amp;rsquo;t taking enough of my time or mental energy to keep me stimulated, and I’ve not found any side projects that pique my interest. I think part of this has to do with not having any concrete goals right now – I have some longer-term ones in the back of my head, like where I want to go after this job and a broader scope of how I want the next 5 years to go, but nothing for the next 6 months – 1 year. So, I thought I would write some down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kigali Update #1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s coming up on the 4-month anniversary of me moving to Kigali (1/6th of the time I’ll be here) so I thought I’d write down some thoughts and reflections of my experience so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conceptually it’s been a bit odd thinking about how different my life/world is now compared to a year ago. I hadn’t even been properly considering leaving home for another year or two and it wasn’t going to be for a low-income country. I was applying to the program that brought me here on a whim following a recommendation from my manager at the time, and in my head wasn’t really considering it as a genuine opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Leaving Home</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone that I know who has ever spoken to me about my dreams in life would be able to tell you that I’ve never seen my long-term future in the UK. Since I can remember, and have been able to contemplate such things, I’ve wanted to explore and live somewhere else in the world. For the most part this has been North America (mainly the United States), and while over time that specific part of the dream has waned, I’ve never properly considered staying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
