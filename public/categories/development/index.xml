      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m spending the week in the northern city of Musanze. It’s for work, and most of my day is spent sitting in a small conference room at a hotel with my colleagues. Living here I’ve chosen to stay in modest accommodation, costing around £8 per night. It’s still in the main city area but closer to the locals than I’m used to in Kigali.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walking down the streets here I can’t help but feel intense guilt and sadness about the state of poverty. On my way back to the conference room from a café I saw a disabled person dragging themselves along the street. They had guards on their legs to stop them scraping and flip flops on their hands to protect from the ground. I walked past knowing that if I looked back I would be asked for money, so I didn’t. It’s the worst I’ve felt about not giving money since arriving here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
