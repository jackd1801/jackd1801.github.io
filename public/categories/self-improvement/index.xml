      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to write more. I want to write a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to take more notes, I want to journal more frequently, and I want to blog more frequently too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently re-read Paul Grahams Essay &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html&#34;&gt;Writing, Briefly&lt;/a&gt; and it affirmed what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently with respect to writing. Writing, and especially writing frequently, is so important for increasing your ability to learn and grow, your ability to communicate with the world, and a whole host of other positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Goals [July - December 2023]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week I’ve been feeling a bit lost about what to do. Work isn&amp;rsquo;t taking enough of my time or mental energy to keep me stimulated, and I’ve not found any side projects that pique my interest. I think part of this has to do with not having any concrete goals right now – I have some longer-term ones in the back of my head, like where I want to go after this job and a broader scope of how I want the next 5 years to go, but nothing for the next 6 months – 1 year. So, I thought I would write some down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
