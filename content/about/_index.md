I’m originally from Scotland, where I have lived for most of my life. I spent 1-year living in Mumbai when I was 12/13 after my Mums job took us overseas. Following that I returned to Scotland to finish my education, including Undergraduate and Masters degrees in Economics.

After completing my education I lived and worked for 3 years in London as a UK civil servant economist before starting my current job as a data scientist for the Government of Rwanda. I’ll be in Rwanda until at least December 2024 and aspire to see as much as Africa as is possible in that time.

My current favourite hobbies are climbing (both bouldering and rope), football, boxing, and reading. Though I’ve also caught a bit of a travel bug now that I’ve started to visit places on my own.
