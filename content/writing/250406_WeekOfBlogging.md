Hello world. It has been a long time (over a year) since I've managed to follow through and write a blog post. A lot has happened in that time and as of yesterday I have finally felt somewhat on top of my life. 

To commemarate such a joyous event I'm going to write a blog post every day this week with the aspiration of actually getting this going with a large collection of writing. 

There are numerous reasons for this, as covered in a previous [post](/writing/230830_WritingMore/) but additionally I have been AI-pilled that writing and publishing things on the internet is probably the most impactful way of having your ideas and therefore view of the world incorporated into the future. I've found myself increasingly using AI for more and more tasks, I think it's made me slightly dumber. I've fallen victim to the outsourcing that I had previously written [about](/writing/231002_OutsourcingThinking.md). To counter this I want to expand on many of the things that I think AI will actually find it hard to replace, and thus become more important as we move into a world where it might replace a lot of the knowledge work that myself, and others like me, currently spend our time on. 

Namely I want to focus on social dynamics, friend making and friends in general, and some level of community building. This will include some how-to's, some general rules and principles that govern social settings, and generally what I've learned over the years as I've transitioned from extremely awkward nerd to slightly awkward nerd. 

I'll also try to upload a few pieces of general commentary, I've done a lot of travelling over the past two years which has given me a lot of perspective about some of the quirks of the world, mostly in relation to Africa. 

Stay tuned.
