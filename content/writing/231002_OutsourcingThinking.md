I've been increasingly using ChatGPT as part of my role and in my personal life for various tasks. This was originally mostly limited to niche coding tasks that I needed help with, or reformatting code that I'd already done. It's saved me a fair amount of time and lets me do more work in a day than I otherwise would have. 

However, over time, I've started using it for daily tasks that I could realistically do on my own in not much longer than it takes to prompt + edit the outputs. And I think that's dangerous for my ability to do my job. Each time I pass the work on I'm becoming less familiar with how to do it myself and the learning that comes with doing tasks repetitively. While this is fine for mundane tasks, the more I outsource higher-level tasks, the more I outsource the actual learning and thinking that comes along with it. 

Often when you speak to managers that have risen above having to do any of the technical analysis themselves, they'll tell you that they wouldn't know how to start doing some of the things they're asking you to do. Technical skills are the same as muscles, and if you don't exercise them they'll start to atrophy. Going from being a manager back down to technical roles is really hard, especially in fields such as data science where technologies and best practice change drastically from year to year. 

The ChatGPT workflow is analogous to becoming a mini manager, delegating the technical work to a lower-level employee. As I'm outsourcing more and more tasks, I feel myself being more and more managerial in workflow. And I can feel my skills getting worse as I do it. When I start a coding project I've started to rely on ChatGPT setting up the barebones code which I can start to edit through further prompts. I'm not doing it myself and I'm not learning through repetition how to code the analysis I want to do, or understanding exactly how the code works to a high-level.

The flip side of this is that by outsourcing the thinking on some of the technical work, I'm able to spend more brain power thinking about the bigger picture. What analysis is most helpful in this situation? What question am I trying to answer? What does this tell me now that I've got a chart to look at? And freeing up time and headspace to think about these things is extremely valuable. 

The challenge is finding balance for these two competing forces. Especially when the technology is in a phase that allows it to hallucinate and create wrong outputs. 

ChatGPT, and tools like it, are productivity enhancing for roles like mine. I can get more done in the same amount of time as I used to because I'm able to outsource various technical tasks that ChatGPT generally excels at. But it comes with a disclaimer that I need to use some of the extra time I get back to fully understand and learn from the outputs. I'm an intermediate level coder so I can quality assure a lot with a quick glance, but sometimes it'll do something more advanced that works and I'll just run with it. Not taking the time to learn how the code fully works is actively detrimental to my own abilities and means that I will become even more dependent on ChatGPT to do the work for me as time goes on. 

I can see this happening at a macro-scale very quickly, and indeed some of my colleagues are increasingly using ChatGPT for both coding and writing tasks. It's especially harmful for writing where the person prompting is not a native speaker of the output language. When you can't properly quality assure the work it's going to come back and bite you. Something will go wrong and it's likely your job that'll be on the line. 

These tools are genuinely miraculous, and I love that it's been created. But we need to make sure that we use them to assist our own thinking and enhance our learning. By enabling us to do higher-level thinking and not get so stuck on the lower level tasks it's generally more productive overall. But by becoming too reliant on it we may completely outsource the thinking, learning, and new ideas that come with doing even the most mundane tasks.
