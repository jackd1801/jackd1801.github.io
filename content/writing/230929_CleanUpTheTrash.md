I'm currently travelling around Mozambique and Eswatini and the most noticeable thing about going around these countries is how much trash there is everywhere. Literally every road is lined with trash thrown out of car windows. In the streets there are open bins with trash overflowing and some that have just been pushed over and descended into trash piles. The problem isn't limited to these two countries obviously but it's so blatant that I've just become radicalised on the issue. 

When you go to countries that take trash seriously, like Singapore, it's so obvious what a quality of life improvement it is to not have the eye sore of trash everywhere. There's a sense of respect that comes with it.
