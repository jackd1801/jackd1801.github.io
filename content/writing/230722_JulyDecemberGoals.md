This past week I’ve been feeling a bit lost about what to do. Work isn't taking enough of my time or mental energy to keep me stimulated, and I’ve not found any side projects that pique my interest. I think part of this has to do with not having any concrete goals right now – I have some longer-term ones in the back of my head, like where I want to go after this job and a broader scope of how I want the next 5 years to go, but nothing for the next 6 months – 1 year. So, I thought I would write some down.

Writing down some goals is almost always useful for me, even if I don’t necessarily achieve them or if they change somewhat along the way. It gives me something to aim for and point myself at when I get into these periods where I’m not quite so sure what I’m doing.

I’m going to break them down into a few different categories – and I’ll leave off some of the more specific work-based ones for organisational privacy. My goals will roughly follow the SMART (Specific Measure Achievable Relevant Time-Bound) framework – something I picked up in the civil service. I’ll do an assessment against this around Christmas time so will say these are to be achieved within the next 5 months.
