One of the most useful ideas from economics for making sense of the world is Stated vs Revealed preferences. 

In short this refers to the fact that most people choose differently in practice than we they say they will in theory. This is a nightmare for almost any company or project that interacts with people and makes decisions based on what they say. I imagine there are millions of entrepreneurs who when describing their product to friends and family were encouraged that all would buy it, but when push comes to shove, they'd be looking awkwardly in the other direction. 

This comes up time and again in almost every domain. People will not do what they say they are going to do a lot of the time.
