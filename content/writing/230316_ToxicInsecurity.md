Insecurity and low self-esteem have been persistent mental health challenges for me throughout my life. These issues began around the age of 9, when I started comparing myself to others more frequently. One of the more toxic consequences of these issues has been its impact in romantic relationships.

My thought pattern typically goes like this:

1. I am not unique or special.
2. I am easily replaceable.
3. If we break up, I give my partner a chance to find someone who is unique/special/irreplaceable.
4. By breaking up, I am doing them a favour and giving them the opportunity to find a better partner.
5. I detach from the relationship and instigate a breakup.

A song thats stuck with me on this, and has probably negatively impacted my thought process, is "Molly" by Lil Dicky. It's about an ex-boyfriend who regrets his past decisions and inability to care for a girl, focusing on his perceived replaceability and lack of contribution to the relationship. One particular line, "You could find another me tomorrow, and that's the hardest pill to swallow," almost perfectly describes how I’ve felt when I’ve been in romantic relationships.

This mindset robs my partner of their ability to feel sad about the breakup. After all, why should they be sad? I’m doing them a favour by letting them find happiness with someone else. It also diminishes my role in the relationship because I don’t see myself as someone that provides them with any joy or meaning.

Ironically, if I genuinely believe in my replaceability, I should have a strong incentive not to break up. Leaving a relationship would put me in a shitty position as I would need to find someone else who thinks I’m worth their time. This should motivate me to work on the relationship I already have, but it doesn’t.

This insecurity has led me to not fully invest in my relationships. I avoid discussing problems because I feel it would be easier for my partner to find someone else, causing me to emotionally withdraw. And it's led me to be surprised at the depth of pain and confusion experienced by my ex-partners, who feel blindsided by the breakup.

My insecurity has justified unhealthy behaviour in relationships based on my incorrect self-image and misconception of my importance to others. I'm actively working on this and have made a decent amount of progress compared to even 6 months ago, and is part of a wider acceptance that I own all of my actions regardless of intent.
