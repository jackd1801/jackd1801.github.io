The statistics are not going in the right direction. 

Introduction

Something that I've found increasingly odd over the past 10 years or so is the apparent disconnect between the domestic and international perception of Scotland compared to the actual reality. It's most likely due to the apparent competence (read: lack of major scandal) of the Scottish National Party (SNP) compared to the UK Government which has gone through a pretty horrid time under the Conservatives. THis perception is starting to break down with the latest financial fraud scandal that saw Nicola Sturgeon resign uncerremoniasly, but still doesn't align with what I believe to be the true nature of Scotland. 

The Kids are not Alright

This is obviously true as you go to visit Scotlands more deprived areas, particularly western coastal towns, but deprivation here is often significantly more acute than it is in other countries across the UK. While we receive more money per capita than any of the other 4 nations, and are a significant net recipient, this doesn't actually manifest as improved outcomes for the Scottish people. 

Across a range of metrics Scotland does worse than England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and this is more true for indicators related to children. While the reform of English schools went through much fanfare early in the Conversatives reign, it has resulted in improved outcomes for their children which have pushed them towards the top of international education rankings. Conversely, the SNPs educational reform has had the opposite effect in Scotland. Anecdotally, the change towards higher level exams was hugely disruptive to the students it affected and was signficantly more convaluted compared to the system that came before it. This has also been reflected in international education rankings with Scotland falling down since the introduction of the reforms. Additionally, child obesity in Scotland is the highest of the 4 nations standing at x% for 2-6 years olds, compared to y%, z%, a% in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, respectively. Across all nations these figures are highest in the most deprived areas. 

Deaths of Despair 

A recent economist article once again highlighted the shockingly high numbers of drug deaths seen in Scotland compared to the other 4 nations and the rest of Europe. We have been consistently multiple times worse than our nearest competitor on this metric, and it doesn't seem like the situation can be resolved in the near future. 

How did this happen?  

The domestic politics of Scotland for the past 15 years or so have faced an unfortunate series of events to have led to these bad outcomes. Coinciding with Labours collapse in 2010 the SNP presented themselves as a competent centre-left alternative while also appealing to the sizeable number of Independence voters across Scotland. This coallition has proved to be near unbeatable for a Labour in dissarray and a weak Liberal Democrat party. 

While the coallition to get them elected has been strong, their competence of governing Scotland has not been up to par. The level of focus that the SNP drive towards the independence question moves scrutiny away from their domestic agenda, and any major issues they face can be resolved by pointing and blaming the Westminster government. This was exarcerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic where Scotland often had worse outcomes than England with nearly the exact same policies which was overshadowed by Nicola Sturgeons daily conferences compared to the sleaze taking place in Westminster. 

Way Forward

There is hope with the collapse of the SNP that things will get better in Scotland. Alec Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon were both political heavyweights that carried the party to outsized levels of power in spite of their domestic achievements. The current leadership does not seem to share their natural charisma or charm, alongside a public that is becoming more and more exhausted by the independence question, may prove to be enough to stop them in their tracks. A Scotland which moves it politics to being more concerned with domestic outcomes within the union would hopefully do much to tackle some of these trends.

While I've talked about issues related to the governning of Scotland, there is a fair point to be made about the level of devolution that we do have. Particularly on the drug issue there is a strong argument to be made that Scotland does not have sufficient power to tackle the problem on their own. Safe Consumption Rooms have been blocked by the UK government, and the lack of devolution of drug policy, means that Scotland does not have all the tools it reqiures to tackle some of these complex problems.
