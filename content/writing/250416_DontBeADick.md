If I could sum up my philosophy on how to be in social situations to a simple phrase, it would be 'Don't be a Dick'. 

It is somewhat remarkable to me how far this simple strategy can go in terms of making people like you and just generally feel like you are doing the right thing. The philosophy itself seems quite strong in British, and moreso Scottish, culuture - indeed whenever someone is being bitchy or annoying about something they will simply be told 'don't be a dick'. Whenever I'm dealing with a slightly morally vague situation or if I'm upset and about to do something I'll pass it by the Don't be a Dick test: if someone else did this action to me, would I consider them a dick?

The beauty of this test is that it is easy to evaluate the results and quick to administer. I subscribe to the idea that you should treat people the way you want to be treated and failing the dick test invites others to treat you badly.
