My ongoing project to make 100 different plots. A take on visas do 100 things mantra to improve my coding, data visualisation, and data discovery skills. Even though I'm still early on the journey for this project it's funny how important the data discovery is in comparison to coding/visualisation, and why I'm somewhat skeptical of how quickly chatGPT will replace people in jobs similar to mine.
